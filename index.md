# About Me

I did my bachelor's and master's in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins. I have research interests in computer vision, unsupervised learning, and applications of machine learning. I currently work in industry as a machine learning engineer.

# Projects

* [Unsupervised Tool Detection in Endoscopic Video Frames](https://github.com/zdavidli/tool-presence)
    * Can we use a variational autoencoder to learn tool representation in surgical video and start to provide labels to medical data?
    * Master's Research Project at Johns Hopkins with [Ayushi Sinha](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayushis/) and [Greg Hager](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/hager/).
    * To appear at the [CLIP Workshop at MICCAI 2020](https://miccai-clip.org/).
    * [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12321)
* [Chirp](https://github.com/zdavidli/chirp)
    * A Twitter bot that reads tweets in the voice of the tweeter. Voice model is trained using one-shot learning.
    * 601.421 Object-Oriented Software Engineering semester-long project.
* [Longitudinal In-vivo Detection of Synapses](https://github.com/zdavidli/LIDS)
    * Track and detect synapses in live mice as they learn motor tasks. Brain scans are taken via two-photon microscopy.
    * Worked with [Joshua Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/)
* [Neural Style Removal](https://github.com/zdavidli/neural-style-removal)
    * Can we improve object detection in abstract artwork by first applying neural style transfer to make artwork more realistic?
    * 601.461 Computer Vision Final Project. [Report](assets/object-detection-artwork.pdf)
* [RNN Stock Prediction](https://github.com/zdavidli/rnn-stock-prediction)
    * Can we beat the market by using an RNN trained on intraday stock data to predict stock market trends?
    * 601.482 Deep Learning Final Project. [Report](assets/rnn-stock-prediction.pdf)

# Teaching

I helped teach a few classes while at JHU

* 110.202 Calculus III - [Notes](calc3.html)
* 550.171 Discrete Mathematics
* 600.271 Automata & Computation Theory
