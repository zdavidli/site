# Calculus III

These notes will tend to be minimal as I use them as a reference for material to cover.
The section numbers reference Vector Calculus, 6th edition by Marsden and Tromba.

The practice problems are my own creation - I found them to be *extremely* useful practice when I was taking the class myself.

In the past, I have also found
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
* [Paul's Online Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/CalcIII.aspx)

to be indispenable resources.
