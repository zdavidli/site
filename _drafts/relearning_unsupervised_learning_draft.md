I've been out of school for over a year now, and I can tell that my machine learning basics are getting a bit rusty.
This post series is an attempt to 1. relearn ML 2. practice technical writing.

This post is going to just be an overview. I plan to follow 

# Machine Learning

# Supervised Learning

# Unsupervised Learning

## Representation Learning

## Self-supervised Learning

# Semi-supervised Learning

# Reinforcement Learning
