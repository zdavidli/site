Patch 11.3

Starting item: Bow

## Stage 2

### Stage 2-2 board

<img src="assets/tft/20200215/g1_22.png" alt="2-2 board" width="500"/>

**In-game thoughts:** I have been playing bow start into Kayle most of the time, so I was angling that way. 
I leveled at 2-1 because I can slam Sunfire Cape and go for a 2-cost chosen since I haven't seen any chosen yet.

Here, I bought the Maokai, Rakan, Veigar, sold Sharpshooters, and played 3 Elderwood 2 Keeper

**Post-game analysis:** I definitely buy the Maokai chosen here, but I thought for a while if I should go for Veigar + Rakan pair and play Elderwood.
Alternative play: buy Maokai and keep playing 2 Sharpshooter for damage. I can sell Elise pair to hold Veigar, but since I don't have any Veigar/Asol item components,
I can wait until carousel or Krugs to commit.

### Carousel
I was forced to pick between 2-cost Belt and Chain. I was still aiming for Kayle so I picked up Belt thinking it could be a Zeke's component.
I think Chain might have been better since it's really bad to get extra Belts.

Lucky Lantern: Belt + Reforger. Getting another belt here feels pretty bad, but at least I can slam and reforge a Warmog's.

### Stage 2-6 board:

<img src="assets/tft/20200215/g1_26.png" alt="2-6 board" width="500"/>

**In-game thoughts:**
Playing 2* units is better than playing 1* units (Fiora + Jarvan > Lulu + Annie), but pick up the Mages anyway.

**Post-game analysis:**
Lulu + Annie might actually be stronger than Fiora + Jarvan and it lets me stack up Veigar faster. Losing Keeper buff is pretty big though, so it's a close call.

Pros: 
* I get to move Sunfire to Rakan who can apply it better than Jarvan (tankier unit, probably holds it for a while)
* 2x Veigar ults to stack him up more, 2x Lulu knockup might be better than Fiora riposte.

Cons:
* Weaker board in terms of stats, risks the win-streak. Keeper buff = 150 shield on Fiora + 300 shield on Veigar, Maokai + 225*2 shield on Keepers = 1200 HP!! 

**Conclusion:**
Playing Fiora + Jarvan is better.

## Stage 3
### Stage 3-1 board:

<img src="assets/tft/20200215/g1_31.png" alt="3-1 board" width="500"/>

Items: Sunfire on board. Free components: 3x Belt, Bow, Sword.

**In-game thoughts:**
I decided to level for Annie (3 Mage) and give her Warmog's as it can be reforged. I kept the other three components.

**Post-game analysis:** I probably should have also slammed Zz'rot Portal as I leveled to keep my winstreak, and getting the Voidling is really good for that.
I didn't slam items because I was still considering a Kayle angle with Zeke's + Bow component, but at this point in the game I should probably give up on that given my item components.

Alternatively, I could have put Giant Slayer on Xayah but then I'm stuck with a Belt that isn't very useful, and I need to start building items for Veigar/Asol.
With the Zz'rot play, I can go for Gunblade (Rod) or Tears off carousel.

**Conclusion:**
Level for Warmog's Annie is fine, but should slam Zz'rot to guarantee streak. Bow and Belt aren't great components in this comp anyway.
Also, commit to Elderwood at this point.

### Stage 3-4 board:

<img src="assets/tft/20200215/g1_34.png" alt="3-4 board" width="500"/>

**In-game thoughts:**
Sold Annie for Nunu (6 Elder) and put the Warmog's on Maokai as I will probably sell him at 4-1. Brawler chosen is not good enough and I will want to roll for 2* Veigar.
I also got the Rod off carousel for Gunblade.

**Post-game analysis:** I definitely need to have slammed Zz'rot. I also needed to reposition Xayah, Rakan, and Nunu to protect the Lulu. 
I ended up losing my streak here because of these two mistakes. Otherwise, my direction is pretty much set here. I scouted and saw no one was playing Asol or Elderwood,
so I can go for 3* units.

## Stage 4

### Stage 4-5 board:

<img src="assets/tft/20200215/g1_45.png" alt="4-5 board" width="500"/>

**In-game thoughts:** Went for tear off carousel as I don't have any of that component for Veigar. 
At 4-1, I rolled to find a new chosen and 2* my board. I found an Elderwood Nunu, so I am potentially looking for 9 Elderwood.
My items from Wolves were 2x Cloak, Glove, Chain.

I slammed Dragon Claw but I was really dizzy as I had too many item components.

**Post-game analysis:**
Should have slammed Zz'rot, as mentioned before, especially as it can help keep my 3-win streak. It can go on Nunu or Rakan.
If I am going for 9 Elderwood, using up both Cloaks is a mistake. However, I think it's a bit risky to go for 9 Elderwood, since I 
will be rolling at level 7 for my 2-costs and I have a <1% chance to hit Ornn. 
Given the information I have, I think I should play for top 4 since I have meh items for Veigar.
Thus, I think Dragon Claw ended up being fine here. I greeded the Tear for Blue Buff, but maybe making HoJ is ok.
In any case, having 5 components is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
DClaw Nunu is fine. Make Zz'rot to keep streak. Play for top 4 and don't go for 9 Elder.

## Stage 5

### Stage 5-7 board:

<img src="assets/tft/20200215/g1_57.png" alt="5-1 board" width="500"/>

**In-game thoughts:**
5-1 rolldown was pretty meh, bench was full but I kept seeing Nunus in shop.
Items: Got a Rod and Spat from creeps, so my components were Bow, Chain, Belt, Rod, Tear, Glove, Spat.
Glove Rod Tear were all useful components, so I reforged the Bow Chain Belt. I ended up getting a Titans from Reforger.

I made Mage Spat and a Jeweled Gauntlet. Other spats aren't very useful so I felt like this was the only play.

Stage 5 carousel was an Elder Spat.

**Post-game analysis:**

Possibly better to also reforge the Warmogs + DClaw as Warmogs falls off late-game.
If I made Zz'rot, I would have been able to reforge it here as well.
Mage Spat Xayah seems like the best play in the moment, but I should have dropped down from 8 Elder to play 5 Mage as my end-game board.
Maokai is not doing anything for me.

It also took a while to hit all my 3*s to the point where the spike wasn't helpful because of my bad items. Top 3 is fine.

---

## Post-game learnings:

With Reforger, I should aggressively slam items for streak. I had a full Zz'rot for at least one stage, which would have made a big difference in my HP and econ.
It also could have helped me be less confused after creep rounds.

I also should have committed to playing Elder much sooner, but should not have greeded for 9 Elderwood as it caused me to play weaker boards.
5 Mage 6 Elder would have been significantly stronger.

I also tilt-rolled at lv 7 to complete my 3* units, but I got burned. I had some HP to spare so I probably should have controlled myself there.

Overall, my macro play was ok but I should have evaluated my board in context of my streak. I played my strongest board for most of the mid/late game,
but I fell behind too much in the end game.
